Travelling Salesman-ish.

First part of this problem divides into two parts:

1. Create a costed, fully connected graph of the numbered nodes.
Costs are the lengths of the shortest paths in the maze.
2. Find the cheapest Hamiltonian path, starting at node 0.

For (1) we repeatedly apply the a* search algorithm, using the
manhattan distance as the heuristic.
For (2) we find the MST, and do a pre-order traversal, visiting
child nodes in order of number of children and edge cost. This
isn't guaranteed to be correct for all graphs - it's a factor-2
approximation worst case.

Part two of the problem closes the loop: find the cheapest Hamiltonian
_cycle_. Only difference is that we now want to visit nodes with
more children first.

But really ---  the correct path is trivially visible by eye-balling
the MST:

             0
            / \
        30 /   \ 44
          /     \
         1       7   (7-1: 54)
         |
     30  |
         |
         3
         |
     66  |
         |
         6
         |
    168  |
         |
         4
        / \
    54 /   \ 56
      /     \
     5       2  (5-2: 74)


For the Hamiltonian path we need:  [0, 7, 1, 3, 6, 4, 5, 2]
For the Hamiltonian cycle we need: [0, 1, 3, 6, 4, 5, 2, 7, 0]
